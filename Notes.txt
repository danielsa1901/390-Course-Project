Got it to work!

Without normalization, we get accuracy's in the 90's
with normalization, we get accuracy's in the 70's, 80's, and sometimes 90's

idk which one we should use, but multiple models have been dumped in the following files:

test.joblib
test2.joblib
test3.joblib
test4.joblib

if you wanna run the model yourself, i suggest you changed the filename of the dump location so you don't overwrite the models we have!
Thanks,
Daniel
